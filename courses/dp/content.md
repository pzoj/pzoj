# Dynamic Programming

## Overview

Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space.

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. It is often used in optimization problems, where the goal is to find the optimal solution to a problem. In this chapter, we will focus on dynamic programming as it applies to optimization problems.
