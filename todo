- BETTER ISOLATION + SECURITY
- generators
- "judging in progress" bar on submission page
- display IE messages on submission page
- better error handling for web backend
- display total time and memory used on submission page
- create a build system and check for required language runtimes (C, C++, PyPy3)
- batched grading (probably would be handled by web backend, not the judge)
- contest leaderboards and stuff
- display compile error
- asm
- remove the submit button when there is currently a submission in progress

KNOWN ISSUES
- loading a nonexistent problem should display a 404 page, not a submission page with no statement
